# Comparison-of-COVID19-other-Viral-Respiratory-Diseases
The main objective of this analysis is to find genetic drivers that affect the phenotype of respiratory diseases caused by viruses like Rhinovirus (common cold/flu) and contrast them with those of COVID19.


At beginning of the pandemic, some of the drugs being prescribed were used for treating HIV and other auto-immune diseases even though there did not seem to be much of a connection. As research progressed, it was discovered that the immune system produced a cytokine storm to overcompensate for the delayed response. The massive amounts of viral load coupled with a cytokine storm led to an increase in disease severity.


So what exactly makes COVID19 deadlier than other viral respiratory diseases? In this study I will try to answer this question by identifying genetic drivers of various respiratory diseases and comparing them with the genetic signatures of critical and non-critical COVID19 patients. I will also try to quantify the response in each of the diseases and use it to stratify patients according to disease severity. The ultimate goal is to construct a genetic signature, with some level of confidence, for each level of severity of COVID19 by associating each gene with a conditional probability.


Lastly, I will compare the list of genetic drivers with the gene targets of drugs that have been tested or are currently in clinical trials for treating COVID19. If time permits, I would also like to look at the pathways that these drivers are involved in and hopefully isolate a common sub-network of "impact".
